This is a showcase of my data cleaning skills using Microsoft excel power query. The dataset was downloaded from https://foresightbi.com.ng/microsoft-power-bi/dirty-data-samples-to-practice-on/ with the data cleaning carried out using power query in excel. Each dataset came with two sheets, a sheet for the raw dirty data and the other sheet for the expected result after cleaning. For the Badly structured sales data with analysis workbook, after cleaning the data with power query, I did a  little analysis of the dataset, creating pivot tables for the dataset and dashboard to show insights from the data.
